# Obfuscated-Text-Classification-

The problem is to build a model which can classify an obfuscated text. 

First a baselin model with different models (Multinomial Naive Bayes, XGBoost and FNN) is built. Then different Deep Learning methods including LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM and CNNs are tried to achieve better performance than the baseline. 

The model was run on the Kaggle platform. For running it locally, change the path in respective cells of Jupyter notebook. 

The data can be found in data folder.
